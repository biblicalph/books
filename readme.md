[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)

This project is my attempt to capture insights from books I read and tutorials I watch for self-reference.
If you are interested in this project and have insights to share or contribute, do feel 
free to send a PR.

The content is organized by programming language and title of books/tutorials.

All the best.
